## Instructions

Read `.agent/config.yaml` for `communicationLanguage` and `responseStyle`. Respond in that language.

```bash
/akit-start (terminal: agent start)
```

**Explain:**
- Sessions scope your working context
- Memories from previous sessions are loaded
- Working memory starts fresh each session

**Tip:** "Work normally — agent-kit works in the background."
