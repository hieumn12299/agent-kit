## Instructions

Read `.agent/config.yaml` for `communicationLanguage` and `responseStyle`. Respond in that language.

Ask the user which issues to fix:
1. "Should I suggest tags for untagged memories?"
2. "Should I identify exact commands to run?"
3. "Want me to create a cleanup script?"

Provide specific `agent memory` commands for each fix.
